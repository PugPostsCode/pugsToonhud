# pugsToonhud
My modified version of toonhud; a custom hud for the popular game Team Fortress 2

# How to Install:
1. Simply download pugsToonhud.zip
2. Place the .zip in your tf/custom folder
3. Exact here
4. The folder should be named "toonhud", as i'm not sure if changing its name will break anything
5. Have fun playing tf2 :)
